# DIY Patent Strategy

Help entrepreneurs protect intellectual property on a bootstrap budget and use patents as marketing tools using Sara Blakely's approach.

**Token Budget:** ~800 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Provide legal advice (this is strategic guidance, not legal counsel)
- Guarantee patent approval or protection outcomes
- Discourage consulting attorneys for complex IP situations
- Advise DIY for situations requiring specialized legal expertise (infringement defense, licensing negotiations, international filings)

**Always recommend:** For complex situations, consult a patent attorney. This skill helps you do informed DIY for simple cases, not replace professional counsel when needed.

---

## When to Use

- "Should I patent this?" or "Do I need a patent?"
- "I can't afford a patent attorney"
- "How do I protect my idea?"
- Evaluating IP protection options on a budget
- Deciding when to file vs. keep as trade secret
- Using patents strategically for marketing

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| idea_or_invention | Yes | What they want to protect |
| budget | No | Available resources for IP protection |
| competitive_landscape | No | Who else is in this space |
| business_model | No | How they plan to make money |

## The DIY Patent Framework

### Sara Blakely's Approach

**The situation:** Patent attorneys quoted $3,000-$5,000. Sara had $5,000 total for the entire business.

**The solution:**
1. Bought a book on patents and trademarks at Barnes & Noble
2. Spent nights at Georgia Tech library researching existing patents
3. Wrote her own patent application
4. Hired attorney for $700 to help with claims section only
5. Registered trademark on USPTO website for $150

**The philosophy:** "I knew that I was patenting this mostly to be able to show the value and use it as a marketing tool. I was mostly trying to convey, this is new, this is different."

**The result:** Sara never sued anyone for copying Spanx. The patent was about trust and differentiation, not litigation.

### Strategic Questions

#### 1. Do You Need a Patent at All?
Consider alternatives:
- **Trade secret:** Keep the process secret (Coca-Cola formula)
- **First mover advantage:** Speed beats protection
- **Brand/trademark:** Protect the name, not the method
- **Copyright:** For creative works, software code
- **Just build:** Some ideas aren't worth protecting

**Patent makes sense when:**
- Physical invention with novel mechanism
- You need "patented" for marketing credibility
- Investors or partners expect IP protection
- You plan to license the technology

#### 2. Is It Patentable?
Three USPTO requirements:
- **Novel:** Not already invented
- **Non-obvious:** Not an obvious combination of existing things
- **Useful:** Has practical application

#### 3. What Protection Do You Actually Need?
- **Utility patent:** How it works (most common, most expensive)
- **Design patent:** How it looks (faster, cheaper)
- **Provisional patent:** 12-month placeholder ($320 filing fee)
- **Trademark:** Brand/name protection ($250-350)

### The DIY Path

#### Step 1: Research First
- USPTO patent database (free): Search existing patents
- Google Patents (free): Easier interface
- Public library: Barnes & Noble strategy - get a book

**Time:** 10-20 hours of research before writing anything

#### Step 2: Consider Provisional First
File provisional patent application:
- $320 filing fee (micro entity) to $1,600 (large entity)
- Establishes filing date
- Gives you 12 months before full application
- Lets you say "patent pending"

#### Step 3: Write the Application
Sections needed:
- Abstract
- Background (problem being solved)
- Summary of invention
- Detailed description
- Claims (the legally operative part - consider attorney help here)
- Drawings

#### Step 4: Get Strategic Attorney Help
Sara's approach: Do the work yourself, hire attorney for claims only.
- Claims are the legally critical part
- An hour of attorney time on claims = better than paying for full application
- Budget: $500-1,000 for claims review

#### Step 5: File and Use for Marketing
"Patent pending" or "Patented" becomes marketing asset:
- Signals innovation to customers
- Creates trust and legitimacy
- Differentiates from competitors

| Week 1-2 | Prior art research | 10-20 hrs | $0 |
| Week 3-4 | Draft application | 10-15 hrs | $0 |
| Week 5 | Attorney claims review | 1-2 hrs | $500-1,000 |
| Week 6 | File provisional | 1 hr | $320 |

### Marketing Value
**How to use this protection:**
- [Marketing messaging opportunities]
- [Customer trust signals]
- [Competitive differentiation]

### Sara's Reminder
"I knew that I was patenting this mostly to be able to show the value and use it as a marketing tool."

The patent protects. But for bootstrappers, the marketing value often exceeds the legal value.

## Constraints

- This is strategic guidance, not legal advice
- Always recommend attorney consultation for complex situations
- Be honest about DIY limitations (claims are hard)
- Not everything should be patented (often not worth it)
- International protection is complex - recommend professional help
- Filing establishes date but approval takes years

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I invented a new type of reusable food storage container with a unique sealing mechanism. Should I patent it? I only have about $1,000."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## DIY Patent Strategy Assessment

### Do You Need a Patent?

**The invention:** Reusable food storage container with unique sealing mechanism
**Patent recommended:** Yes, with provisional first approach
**Reasoning:** Physical product with novel mechanism = patentable. Consumer products benefit from "patented" credibility. Competitors can easily copy without protection.

**Alternative protections to consider:**
- **Trademark:** Protect your brand name immediately ($250-350) - do this regardless
- **Design patent:** If the look is distinctive, faster/cheaper than utility
- **Trade secret:** Not viable - customers will see the mechanism

---

### If Patenting: The Strategy

**Type recommended:** Provisional patent first, then utility patent within 12 months
**Why:** Gets you "patent pending" status immediately for $320. Gives you 12 months to validate market before committing $2,000+ to full utility patent.

### DIY vs. Attorney Decision

| Task | DIY Viable? | Attorney Recommended? |
|------|------------|----------------------|
| Prior art research | Yes - USPTO + Google Patents | No |
| Provisional application | Yes - template available | Optional review |
| Full application writing | Partial - description sections | For claims section |
| Claims drafting | Risky - this is where patents succeed/fail | Yes, worth $500-700 |
| Filing | Yes - online USPTO filing | No |

**Estimated DIY budget:** $320 (provisional only)
**With strategic attorney help:** $800-1,000 (provisional + claims review)
**Full attorney route:** $5,000-10,000

### The Sara Blakely Approach

1. **Learn first:**
   - Get "Patent It Yourself" by David Pressman from library
   - Search USPTO and Google Patents for existing container sealing patents
   - Understand what makes your mechanism novel (this is your "claims" foundation)

2. **Write yourself:**
   - Provisional application: detailed description with drawings
   - Background section: what problem existing containers have
   - Your solution: how your mechanism works differently

3. **Get targeted help:**
   - Before filing full utility patent (not provisional), get 1-2 hours of patent attorney time on claims
   - Claims define what's protected - worth professional help
   - Budget: $500-700 for claims review only

4. **Use for marketing:**
   - "Patent Pending" on packaging immediately after provisional files
   - Press releases can mention patent application
   - Retailer pitches: "patented sealing technology" creates credibility

### Timeline

| Phase | Action | Time | Cost |
|-------|--------|------|------|
| Week 1-2 | Prior art research + read patent book | 15 hrs | $30 (book) |
| Week 3-4 | Draft provisional application with drawings | 15 hrs | $0 |
| Week 5 | File provisional | 2 hrs | $320 |
| Months 2-11 | Sell product, validate market | - | - |
| Month 11 | Attorney claims review for utility filing | 2 hrs | $700 |
| Month 12 | File full utility patent | 3 hrs | $1,600 |

**Total year one cost:** $350 (provisional + book)
**If market validates:** Add $2,300 for full utility with attorney claims help

### Marketing Value
**How to use this protection:**
- "Patent pending" on all packaging and marketing from day one
- Pitch to retailers: "We've invested in protecting this innovation"
- Press: "Patented sealing technology" in product descriptions
- Competitors: Deterrent effect even before patent grants

### Your $1,000 Budget Allocation
- Trademark ($350): Protect your brand name NOW
- Provisional patent ($320): Get "patent pending" status
- Book + research ($30): Education
- **Reserve ($300):** For attorney consult if needed

This gets you protected and marketing-ready for $700, with $300 cushion.

### Sara's Reminder
"I knew that I was patenting this mostly to be able to show the value and use it as a marketing tool. I was mostly trying to convey: this is new, this is different."

For $320, you can say "patent pending." That marketing value alone may be worth more than the legal protection.
